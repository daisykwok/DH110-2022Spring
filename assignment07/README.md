#### Assignment 07: Interactive Prototype
# High Fidelity Prototype

Daisy Kwok | DH 110 User Experience and Design | Spring 2022

## About the Project
This project aims to provide a simple way of taking free online courses to learn about music production, using SoundGym as the website to be improved and refined as a mobile app. The main function of SoundGym is to be able to watch course videos about producing music, so my project focuses on how to streamline that experience of watching courses and selecting learning programs. 

I used Figma to create this high fidelity prototype, which was built upon a low-fidelity protype from the previous project step. The purpose of this high fidelity prototype is to test out the functionality of the revised app's graphical design interface. The interactive element of the protype allows for it to be tested by a user hands-on, so that I can evaluate whether or not the user can complete the specified tasks of the project and follow the intended flow. 

## Prototype Tasks
Based on the personas developed in previous stages, this high fidelity protype supports the following tasks: 
- Watching course videos 
  - From the perspective of a new user
  - From the perspective of a user resuming a learning program
- Switching between learning programs 
- Navigating the help center
