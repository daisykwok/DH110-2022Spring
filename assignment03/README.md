#### Assignment 03: Qualitative User Research 
# Contextual Inquiry
Daisy Kwok | DH 110 User Experience and Design | Spring 2022

## Design Challenge
This project's main design challenge is as follows: How might we help users learn to produce music in an easily-understandable way within a comfortable environment?

To aid in determining the project's design challenge, several questions were posed: 
* **What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**
  * This project will support users in learning how to produce music by connecting them with online courses tailored to their interests and skill level. 
* **What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**
  * This activity will fulfill the user’s esteem and cognitive needs. By learning how to produce music, the user will be gaining a new skillset, which will add to the user’s sense of achievement and self-confidence. With music production being a highly creative and independent activity, the user will also gain a sense of creative freedom and mental stimulation. 
* **What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
  * Traditional solutions to satisfy this need involve  in-person classes, whether that be group classes hosted by community organizations and colleges, or one-on-one lessons with teachers or friends who are already experienced and/or in the industry. Books on music production are also part of the traditional solution. Currently, solutions also increasingly involve YouTube videos where people teach about music production for free.
* **What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with digital technology?**
  * For some users, geographical location could limit what opportunities are available to them. In-person classes may be too far away to reasonably take, or those that are closest to them may not be of the highest quality or may not be suitable to their unique interests within music production. Additionally, time can also be a constraint for users who desire a more flexible learning plan and are only able to work on building this skill when they have free time. Digital technology would be able to deal with this constraint of distance and time by bringing classes into the user’s own home, enabling them to take lessons at their own pace according to their own convenience. 

## Target Users
We can expect that the characteristics of the target users will be as follows: 
* **Demographics:** Working and retired adults, young adults in high school and college (mostly male based on the specified premises of this project)
* **Preferences:** Users should have a desire to learn about producing music, or at least have an interest in music more generally
* **Expertise:** There is no minimum level of expertise required for this project; both users with no knowledge about producing music and users with some or a lot of knowledge are all welcome to utilize this project. 

In the traditional setting, users would do this activity either in a classroom setting (or something similar) or within a studio, in order to gain knowledge and hands-on experience with producing. 

In order to learn how to produce music, users would typically search online for music production courses available near them, or search for online courses that they can take. If the user wishes to take classes in-person, the user would typically need to contact the institution or teacher, schedule lessons/appointments, and physically go to “class”. If the user wishes to watch online courses, the user will search and find the appropriate videos for their interests, and will watch them from the comfort of their own home or office. 

## Research Methods
I decided to utilize a combination of two methods: **interview** and **participatory observation**. Both the interview and participatory observation were conducted on Zoom, with the participant logging on from the comfort of their own bedroom, which is where they typically are when they are producing music. 

During the **interview** portion, I asked the participant various questions regarding his background in music production, how often he spends working on producing, what his goals and motivations are for producing, what types of resources he used to learn to produce, and any challenges he has encountered when producing. While a script was written for the interview, at times, I did go off-script to ask relevant follow-up questions to encourage the participant to elaborate on certain points. 

For the **participatory observation** portion of the session, I asked the participant to imagine that they went back in time to when they were still a novice at producing music (since the participant is quite skilled at producing now). Then, I asked the participant to think of and demonstrate an activity that they would do to practice their skills when first learning to produce. After wrapping up that task, I also asked the participant what they would search up on the Internet if they were starting from a level of knowledge where they know nothing about producing music.

### Interview Insights
The following are some notable insights from the interview:<br>

:one: **The particpant's main resource for learning, both early on and until today, has been YouTube.**
> "I think my first and still like honestly, the source of learning is through YouTube. Because I remember back then they would have like these like, there'll be people that would be putting up like, oh, how to make like a trance track in like 30 minutes, you know? And so it was just like them just like taking this whole like, filming this whole hour, or like half an hour to have them just like producing and what I would do is just kind of like mimic that and follow it and just kind of like put myself through their process too. And just like copying whatever they're doing." (2:19)
<br>

:two: **Besides hands-on experience creating music in program, the participant mentioned listening to music as a way of learning about different sounds and creative choices.**
> "But otherwise, I think it's like, a lot of listening. Just like listening to music and try to figure out and think about like, Oh, how did this musician do that? Like, this sound like I've never heard before or like, kind of paying attention to like certain techniques that they're doing and trying to like, remember what they did. And then going into the, pretty much the program, and trying to copy that, what he did." (4:08)
<br>

:three: **While there are some economic barriers to learning to produce, the participant emphasized the availability of free resources online**
> "I think because there's so many resources out there, and I'll tell you this, I feel like a lot producers are also so broke, that they understand that paid is not like The Thing. You know, paid is not like the jam. So I think it's like that's the beauty of it. I think the community like really loves like sharing this information. Honestly in terms of like paid content I think the only thing I'd ever like, really take for would be Masterclass because there is some like people on there that just like oh they share like gems you know." (16:02)
<br> 

:four: **Ultimately, the participant feels that hands-on experience and experimenting with producing in-program is the most effective way of learning to make music.**
> "But honestly, the craziest resource, is actually, to not even look at any of that. And like literally like just making it. Like I know that sounds counterintuitive, but it's just like, there's no other like resource other than just experimenting. Like that's the whole thing. I feel like you're gonna learn like what other people do like. But the only way you can learn like what you can do is to open it mess around and just like playing around and not even understanding it because I go into these programs not understanding a thing, but it takes all of that messing around and then I find like, Oh, this is actually like the fastest way to learn it. Surprisingly, without having like a teacher." (17:02)

## Reflection
Going into this process of planning and conducting an interview, I was actually quite nervous due to the open-ended nature of contextual inquiry. My project is focused on a website offering courses on different topics in music production, but this is not necessarily something that I myself am familiar with. Producing music is a process that feels very abstract to me, so I found writing the interview script to be a bit challenging at times because I wasn't sure what exactly to ask, if what I was asking made sense, or even how to phrase what I wanted to know. Despite this, I think that the interview went pretty well. We did go off-script at times, but I think that was a necessary and expected part of interviewing someone with the intention of trying to better understand their experience.

Additionally, while I tried to find a participant that was as close to the target audience as possible, I felt that the participant's expertise was something I didn't expect. There were some questions and tasks I wanted the participant to answer or do from the perspective of someone who is just beginning to learn to produce, but it seemed like it was a bit difficult for the participant to entirely separate himself from his current skill level. For example, one of the tasks I wanted the particiapnt to do was to imagine what kind of activity they would do to practice producing under the assumption that they are transported back to a time when they were first learning to make music. The participant jumped right into making a loop in Ableton (a music producing program), which deviated from the range of activities I was anticipating (ie: showing different Youtube videos or searches he would watch/make, or websites that he used as resources to learn). 

Another challenge for me personally was trying to conduct the interview smoothly. Even though I had a script, I felt like I could have conducted the interview with less stumbling (especially the use of "um" and "like"), and explain what I wanted the participant to do in a more clear and concise way. I don't think that really impacted how the participant answered or acted throughout the interview, but it is something I want to work on personally.

Overall, this process went pretty well and I was able to learn more about how the average person interested in music would go about learning to make music. The main takeaway that I got from the interview was that producing is a very hands-on activity, and doing it yourself through experimentation on your own time is the best way to learn. For people interested in producing, the most straightforward way of looking up information about producing is by simply searching online for YouTube videos, and not necessarily a full course online or in-person.
