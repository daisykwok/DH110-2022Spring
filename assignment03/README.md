#### Assignment 03: Qualitative User Research 
# Contextual Inquiry

## Design Challenge
This project's main design challenge is as follows: How might we help users learn to produce music in an easily-understandable way within a comfortable environment?

To aid in determining the project's design challenge, several questions were posed: 
* **What is the main activity your project would support for the users?**
  * This project will support users in learning how to produce music by connecting them with online courses tailored to their interests and skill level. 
* **What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?**
  * This activity will fulfill the user’s esteem and cognitive needs. By learning how to produce music, the user will be gaining a new skillset, which will add to the user’s sense of achievement and self-confidence. With music production being a highly creative and independent activity, the user will also gain a sense of creative freedom and mental stimulation. 
* **What are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
  * Traditional solutions to satisfy this need involve  in-person classes, whether that be group classes hosted by community organizations and colleges, or one-on-one lessons with teachers or friends who are already experienced and/or in the industry. Books on music production are also part of the traditional solution. Currently, solutions also increasingly involve YouTube videos where people teach about music production for free.
* **What are the limitations that possibly would be improved with digital technology?**
  * For some users, geographical location could limit what opportunities are available to them. In-person classes may be too far away to reasonably take, or those that are closest to them may not be of the highest quality or may not be suitable to their unique interests within music production. Additionally, time can also be a constraint for users who desire a more flexible learning plan and are only able to work on building this skill when they have free time. Digital technology would be able to deal with this constraint of distance and time by bringing classes into the user’s own home, enabling them to take lessons at their own pace according to their own convenience. 

## Target Users
We can expect that the characteristics of the target users will be as follows: 
* **Demographics:** Working and retired adults, young adults in high school and college (mostly male based on the specified premises of this project)
* **Preferences:** Users should have a desire to learn about producing music, or at least have an interest in music more generally
* **Expertise:** There is no minimum level of expertise required for this project; both users with no knowledge about producing music and users with some or a lot of knowledge are all welcome to utilize this project. 

In the traditional setting, users would do this activity either in a classroom setting (or something similar) or within a studio, in order to gain knowledge and hands-on experience with producing. 

In order to learn how to produce music, users would typically search online for music production courses available near them, or search for online courses that they can take. If the user wishes to take classes in-person, the user would typically need to contact the institution or teacher, schedule lessons/appointments, and physically go to “class”. If the user wishes to watch online courses, the user will search and find the appropriate videos for their interests, and will watch them from the comfort of their own home or office. 

## Research Methods
I decided to utilize a combination of two methods: **interview** and **participatory observation**. Both the interview and participatory observation were conducted on Zoom, with the participant logging on from the comfort of their own bedroom, which is where they typically are when they are producing music. 

During the **interview** portion, I asked the participant various questions regarding his background in music production, how often he spends working on producing, what his goals and motivations are for producing, what types of resources he used to learn to produce, and any challenges he has encountered when producing. While a script was written for the interview, at times, I did go off-script to ask relevant follow-up questions to encourage the participant to elaborate on certain points. 

For the **participatory observation** portion of the session, I asked the participant to imagine that they went back in time to when they were still a novice at producing music (since the participant is quite skilled at producing now). Then, I asked the participant to think of and demonstrate an activity that they would do to practice their skills when first learning to produce. After wrapping up that task, I also asked the participant what they would search up on the Internet if they were starting from a level of knowledge where they know nothing about producing music.
