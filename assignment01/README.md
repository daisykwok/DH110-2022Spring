#### Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation
# Music Production through Web-Based Learning
Daisy Kwok | DH 110 User Experience and Design | Spring 2022

## Introduction
Our world has become increasingly dominated by new technology and media, enabling people to access all types of information with a few clicks on a computer. With the advent of the Internet, learning new skills has become more convenient due to online tutorials and other web-based learning platforms. People are no longer restricted by the constraints of physical distance or even financial resources, because for almost any skill, there are a multitude of free, online learning methods that can be chosen from and used from the comfort of one's own home. 

One example of a skill that can now be learned online is music production. While this was once a skill that had to be learned in-person, there are now a wide range of websites that offer free and paid courses on how to produce music, often incorporating digital tools that give students an opportunity to experiment with music production on a laptop or computer without needing professional equipment. 

Keeping in mind the target audience of middle-aged men interested in music learning, this evaluation will analyze two websites that offer music production lessons: [SoundGym](https://www.soundgym.co/site/school?ut=school&ut=school) and Ableton's beta version of [Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/). Each website will be evaluated against Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). Any errors identified will be given a severity rating based on Nielson's [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/), which are as follows: 
Rating | Description 
--- | --- 
1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
4 | Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released

Through this project, I aim to get a better understanding of what features contribute to and/or take away from a good user experience of each website, and be able to propose recommended improvements that may refine the user experience. From this process, I want to make note of both what works to create a great user experience and what features can be major flaws, in order to appy these to the creation of my own online learning platform for music production. 

## Website 1: [SoundGym](https://www.soundgym.co/site/school?ut=school&ut=school)
![SoundGym Home Page](./soundgym.jpg)

### Background 

**About the Site:** Described as a “gym for your ears”, SoundGym is an online music learning platform that offers courses on various topics in music production, like recording & audio engineering, electronic music production, mix & mastering, and more. SoundGym offers both free and paid classes, but unlike many other music learning sites, the free version of its courses are more extensive relative to other platforms. Additionally, its program is complemented by daily ear training games that are geared towards improving one’s understanding of important concepts such as peak, EQ, and gain. 

**Overall Evaluation:** Upon first glance, SoundGym appears to be a fairly straightforward website offering free music production classes. The simple home page easily guides the user to begin learning through its “Start Learning Button”. However, SoundGym offers a wide range of other features, such as daily ear training games, daily competitions, community boards, and more, but it is difficult to understand what these features are as they have highly specific names in the main menu, which users may not be familiar with coming onto the program. 

### Heuristic Evaluation

Heuristic | Evaluation | Severity Rating | Recommendation 
--- | --- | --- | --- 
**1. Visibility of System Status** <br>The website keeps users informed about what is going on, showing the current status or progress with feed back in a timely manner | 301 | 283 | 290 
**2. Match between systems and the real world**<br> The website uses language that is familiar to the user, presenting information in a logical way that is reflective of the real world | 301 | 283 | 290
**3. User control and freedom**<br> The website allows users to easily undo or exit from an unintended action, giving users a sense of control over the system | 301 | 283 | 290
**4. Consistency and standards**<br> The website should be consistent with the conventions followed by other similar websites to avoid user confusion and minimize the effort needed to learn the new system | 301 | 283 | 290
**5. Error prevention**<br> The website minimizes the possibility of errors, or checks for them and offers a confirmation message before allowing the user proceed should they wish to | 301 | 283 | 290
**6. Recognition rather than recall**<br> The website ensures that the information needed to navigate through the site is visible and accessible | 301 | 283 | 290
**7. Flexibility and efficiency of use**<br> The website offers different ways for users to complete the same task, so that the process can be tailored to each user’s unique level of experience | 301 | 283 | 290
**8. Aesthetic and minimalist design**<br> The website contains only information that is relative and aligned with the site’s goals | 301 | 283 | 290
**9. Help users recognize, diagonize, and recover from errors**<br> Error messages on the website should be written in language that is easy to understand, and should clearly identify the problem and a suggested solution | 301 | 283 | 290
**10. Help and documentation**<br> The website offers documentation that provides users with additional instructions should they need help using the website | 301 | 283 | 290



## Website 2: Ableton's beta version of [Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/)
![Learning Music Home Page](./learningmusic.jpg)

### Background 

**About the Site:** Taking on a more unconventional approach, Ableton’s beta version of Learning Music is an interactive website that introduces users to the basics of music making through guided lessons with digital tools that mimic other music production programs. Intended to be worked through page by page according to various topics and lessons, the website covers subjects such as beats, notes and scales, chords, basslines, and more. 

**Overall Evaluation:** At first glance, Learning Music gives the user the feeling of playing a game, offering a hands-on experience that feels welcoming to people of all levels of experience in music production. However, the website jumps straight into the first lesson without offering an idea of how long the course is. The minimalist look of the website, while offering a clean aesthetic, may not be the most user friendly for our target audience of middle aged men.
