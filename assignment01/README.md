#### Assignment 01: Heuristic Evaluation
# Music Production through Web-Based Learning
Daisy Kwok | DH 110 User Experience and Design | Spring 2022

## Introduction
Our world has become increasingly dominated by new technology and media, enabling people to access all types of information with a few clicks on a computer. With the advent of the Internet, learning new skills has become more convenient due to online tutorials and other web-based learning platforms. People are no longer restricted by the constraints of physical distance or even financial resources, because for almost any skill, there are a multitude of free, online learning methods that can be chosen from and used from the comfort of one's own home. 

One example of a skill that can now be learned online is music production. While this was once a skill that had to be learned in-person, there are now a wide range of websites that offer free and paid courses on how to produce music, often incorporating digital tools that give students an opportunity to experiment with music production on a laptop or computer without needing professional equipment. 

Keeping in mind the target audience of middle-aged men interested in music learning, this evaluation will analyze two websites that offer music production lessons: [SoundGym](https://www.soundgym.co/site/school?ut=school&ut=school) and Ableton's beta version of [Learning Music](https://learningmusic.ableton.com/). Each website will be evaluated against Nielson's [10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/). Any errors identified will be given a severity rating based on Nielson's [Severity Ratings for Usability Problems](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/), which are as follows: 
Rating | Description 
--- | --- 
1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
4 | Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released

Through this project, I aim to get a better understanding of what features contribute to and/or take away from a good user experience of each website, and be able to propose recommended improvements that may refine the user experience. From this process, I want to make note of both what works to create a great user experience and what features can be major flaws, in order to appy these to the creation of my own online learning platform for music production.
