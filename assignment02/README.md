#### Assignment 02: Usability Testing
# SoundGym Pilot UT
Daisy Kwok | DH 110 User Experience and Design | Spring 2022

## Introduction

**About the Site**<br>
For the purpose of this pilot UT, I will be testing the website [SoundGym](https://www.soundgym.co/site/school?ut=school&ut=school). As its name suggests, SoundGym is an online music learning platform that offers courses on various topics in music production, like recording & audio engineering, electronic music production, mix & mastering, and more. The website offers an extensive program of both paid and free courses, which are complemented by daily ear training games designed to strengthen one's ability to detect changes in peak, EQ, gain, and more. 

**What is UT?**<br>
Usability testing (UT) is one method of gathering user feedback in the user-centered design process. Usability testing evaluates the extent to which a user interface is easy to use, based on the three metrics of usability: effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. Usability testing involves asking users to complete tasks under specified scenarios while sharing aloud their thoughts and opinions throughout the process, enabling the moderator to observe firsthand how people use the product/user interface. 

**Purpose of SoundGym Pilot UT**<br>
After conducting a heuristic evaluation of SoundGym, I identified several issues with the design of the website that limit its usability. This pilot UT is aimed at exploring these issues to measure the extent to which they obstruct the usability of SoundGym. The issues that I focused on for this UT, including the task I used to evaluate it, are as follows:<br>

Heuristic | Usability Issue | Task Scenario 
--- | --- | ---
User control and freedom | Once a user commits to a specific learning program, it is difficult to change to a different one because the button to do so is hard to find. | Quit from the current learning program, locate the list of all available programs, and commit to a new one
Consistency and standards | The Help Center is listed in a drop-down menu under the main menu. It is difficult to find because it is signified through a "microphone" icon and is sub-listed with many other items.| Locate the Help Center and narrow by FAQ topic to find an answer to a question regarding billing information
Recognition rather than recall | There are no "Play" buttons for any of the videos, so the user has to intuitively know to click to begin taking a course and must assume the ability to skip course videos that are not relevant to their learning. | Locate a specific course video and skip to that video

The format of the UT consisted of an introduction, informed consent, background questions, pre-test questions, task scenarios, post-test questions, system usability scale (SUS), product satisfaction cards, and demographics. Additionally, as you can see through the survey and video linked below, I had the participant complete more than the three tasks listed above, as use of the SoundGym website requires the user to create and account and complete an initial set-up process.

## Reflection
Through this pilot UT, I was able to observe that the issues I rated most severely during the heuristic evaluation actually translated into major obstacles that limited the usability of SoundGym. The participant is not someone who falls into the characteristics of the target audience, and is someone I consider to be quite technologically adept. Yet, the tasks of switching learning programs and locating the help center proved to be very challenging, indicating an urgent need for these features to be redesigned. Moreoever, as I mentioned above, I did ask the participant to complete a series of other tasks outside of what I identified from the heuristic evaluation. The partcipant was asked to create an account, complete the initial set-up process, commit to a learning program and watch the first course video, and locate their progress status. From this, I was able to identify even more usability issues with SoundGym, while other tasks confirmed the ease of use of other features. For example, I observed from the set-up process how it can be confusing for users who are not familiar with music terminology, as many of the interest surveys and games involved complex terminology. On the flip side, tasks like finding the progress status were fairly straightforward, confirming my rating of certain issues as merely cosmetic.

As a moderator, the process of conducting a UT went fairly well. Although it is most likely due to the fact that the participant is someone I already know, I found that it was not too difficult to create a comfortable space while maintaining professionalism. Looking back on the UT video, I wish I had encouraged the participant to narrate/speak aloud more of their thoughts. One thing I really struggled with was figuring out how to draw out the thoughts of the participant without asking questions that would influence how they interacted with the website, so I often found myself being pretty silent during the task scenarios. During the UT itself, I was also questioning whether my task scenario instructions were too specific or not specific enough because I felt like it was difficult to discern whether the steps were revealing the "answer" to how to complete the task. Moreover, there was a disruption during the UT as my roommate unexpectedly came into the room. In the future, I will definitely make sure that the space will be secure and free from disruptions, and I also want to work on the skill of asking neutral questions that encourage participants to share their thoughts aloud.
