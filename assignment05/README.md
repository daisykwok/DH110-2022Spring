#### Assignment 04: UX Wireframe/Paper Prototype
# Low Fidelity Prototype
Daisy Kwok | DH 110 User Experience and Design | Spring 2022

## Overview 
### About the Project
This project aims to simplify the process of using a free online course to learn how to produce music. Focusing on the website SoundGym, this low fidelity prototype redesigns the placement of certain features to streamline the learning experience, so that users of all backgrounds can easily navigate through the site to accomplish their unique goals with as little complications or confusion as possible.  

Previously, I developed two different personas to get a better understanding of the wants, needs and goals of the average user within the target audience.
